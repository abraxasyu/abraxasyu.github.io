## Personal goals for the conference
- Terminology/ontology
  - Linking heterogeneous data with standard ontologies and terminologies sound simple but can be cumbersome in reality due to spelling errors, formatting differences, versioning issues, disagreement among codes (e.g. MMSL vs NDC to RXCUI), and so on.
  - Linking across ontologies also seems challenging (though admittedly, I haven't played around too much with UMLS).
  - There are some session regarding LOINC (W04), SNOMED CT, RXNORM (W14), etc. and I hope to see what innovative approaches exist or are in development.
- Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
  - Now that I have at least a working knowledge of these tools (mainly sklearn, tensorflow, keras), I hope to be able to at least develop an intuitive understanding of the stats/ML-heavy sessions.
  - I've been kicking around the idea of temporal phenotyping project, so I'm especially curious about the use of, for example, autoencoders in phenotyping.
  - I'll be keeping an eye out for the juggernauts in this field (D. Sontag, J. Sun)
- Sepsis
  - As I am currently working on a Sepsis prediction project, I'll be keeping my eyes peeled for any sepsis-related projects.
  - There are a handful of sessions/posters: infant sepsis prediction using LR, SVM, AdaBoost, fluid/vasopressor administration strategy optimization using kernel and reinforcement learning, vasopressor initiation for septic-shock-risk patients in ED, in-hosp mortality prediction for ICU pats using GBM, septic shock prediction in ICU using bayesian network analysis, evaluation of Epic's sepsis prediction model, and understanding delays in sepsis recognition and treatment. I'm especially interested in Deep AISE which is a deep learning based sepsis early prediction tool that is actually in use in Emory's eICU.
- CDS in LHS
  - Another idea I've been kicking around is the idea of a CDS that adapts to local environments. It could be as simple as retraining every once in a while using data from deployed environments. I'm curious if anybody will touch on this subject.
