## LOINC presentation by [Daniel J. Vreeman](https://danielvreeman.com/presentation/) & Swapna Abhyankar
- Motivation: There are multiple types of, for example, temperature readings like body surface, oral, arterial blood, etc. For any given institution, each of these may have their own codes, and to get them all, one may have to use approximate string matching. We often want to develop with multiple institutions in mind, and other institutions may have their own terms and their own codes. Mapping all observables to LOINC allows you to organize the data, make apps that work across institutions, expedite data pre-processing, etc.
- LOINC, suprisingly, covers not only labs, but all observables including environmental, wearable-generated, survey responses, etc.
- The hierarchy admittedly is a bit confusing. There are panels, convinience groups, groups, etc. Of those, [groups](https://loinc.org/groups/) seem especially interesring.
- Regarding ontologies/terminologies/vocabularies, there is an [Interoperability Standards Advisory](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/section-i-vocabularycode-setterminology-standards-and-implementation-specifications) that is attempting to identify relevant ontologies/terminologies/vocabularies for each data type.
- There is a mapping bewteen [LOINC and SNOMED-CT](https://loinc.org/news/beta-edition-of-draft-loinc-snomed-ct-mappings-and-expression-associations-now-available/) that is used by UMLS. LOINC do not directly assist UMLS mapping.
- project idea: hop through  to retrieve all relevant observables (LOINC codes) for, say Heart Failure
- Their software, RELMA, can be used for semi-automated mapping to LOINC terms.
- LOINC has an [online FHIR-compatible API](https://fhir.loinc.org)
- LOINC has a microbiology mapping implementation guide. Project idea: national antibiogram
- Some Smart-On-Fhir apps require LOINC mapping. Question: do we (BJC) do this for non-lab observables?

## RxNORM
- NDC is time-specific, yet there is no comprehensive historical NDC dataset. RxNORM maintains NDCs for on-market drugs. RxNORM API can handle expired NDC mappings using [ndcstatus](https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIREST.html#uLink=RxNorm_REST_getNDCStatus)
- FDA disallowed re-using expired codes, and is running out of NDCs, so they're looking to replace the codeset
- There are [alternative drug classification systems] to ATC. VA Classes, for example, maps drugs directly, not ingredients. Takeaway: don't use ATC. Maybe try U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention's classification system. Note: Talk to Shinji@WashU. Maybe just map to RxNORM.
- rate limit is 20/sec. The MIMIC-III sample (100 patient) dataset contains ~1000 unique NDC ids. This means 50 seconds.
- history of OHDSI/OMOP based on vioxx aftermath, sentinel initiative (large scale (100 mil patients) after-market surveillance)
- Question: is RxNORM integration part of OMOP, in which case, the mapping should be getting done regardless for BJC RDC or even HDC.
