## W28: FHIRÂ© -- Implementing the HL7 Interoperability Platform: A Community of Implementers for Research, Patient Care, and Value-based Care
- Question: do differing profiles break interoperability?
- Maturity level (0-5) assigned for each FHIR resource starting with release 2. Normative resource means that it's fully developed/functional.
- Aside: the "Unreasonable Effectiveness of X" trend started not with RNNs but in [1960's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences)
- Question: is there an android version of apple's fhir-compatible health app? Is anyone doing the work? What apps exist that pull clinical data, and what dev shops make them?
- [Sync4Science](http://syncfor.science/): implementation of the fhir/data-sharing/interoperability "dream"
  - For S4S, argonaut profile had to be relaxed so non-academic hospitals with imperfect data can participate
  - Argonaut profile was primarily driven by MU3 requirements
  - Helps orgs supply and consume data
- Question: What is FHIR connectathon?
- [CDS Hooks](https://github.com/kpshek/cds-hooks-presentation), [sandbox](http://sandbox.cds-hooks.org/)
  - clinical reasoning resource: local CDS. CDS Hooks is envisioned to be for remote CDS.
  - CDS service invoked via `hooks`, returns CDS via `cards`
    - hooks include `patient-view` or `medication-prescribe`
    - Question: are EHRs ready to handle CDS `cards`? What happens when there is delay - does the EHR hang? Is it possible that a warning would appear for the wrong patient if the user opens a patient chart, quickly closes it, and opens another patient's chart?
	- user analytics/response information not part of 1.0
- Argonaut
  - Vendor & provider orgs got together to accelerate use of FHIR
  - [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208647)  has adopted the Argonaut/FHIR standard in a major way
  - EHR certification reqs are the primary driver
  - 2018 projs: notes, bulk data, questionnaires
- [Bulk data sharing](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-bulk-data-docs)
  - standizing business/legal agreements is important but not yet tackled. Dr. Payne mentioned this previously.
  - uses ndjson = streamable json
  - still in dev, but has huge potential. current bulk data exchange is often done through csv/ftp. could aid registry, hdc > rdc, payer to provider, parent ehr merge, etc.

## Opening Plneary Session & Keynote
- Very humorous video by D. Fridsma and P. Embi. In their speeches, they emphasize how academia is the backbone of AMIA and how industry/applications were built on academic works of AMIA past.
- CMO of verily (formerly project x, google skunkworks), Jessica Mega (senior investigator for TIMI study) came to talk about ML in healthcare. She spoke about 1. onduo, virtual diabetes clinic with continuous glucose monitoring device 2. famous diabetic retinopathy research, now looking at predicting/detecting things that real clinicians wouldn't even think about like cardiovascular status 3. debug, a mosquito pop reduction project (releasing sterilized male into wild). Already ran in fresno, piloting in austrailia.
- 2/4 of the student dissertation award finalists were about temporal phenotyping. One of the winners was: [Semi-Supervised Learning for Electronic Phenotyping in Support of Precision Medicine by Yonatan Halpern, Software Engineer at Google, Inc., David Sontag Trainee](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7add/70c335e4ce7be41238874aa388308b9ed510.pdf?_ga=2.215300311.1976935399.1541404797-1989591948.1524866524)
- winner of student paper competition was not about ML/DL, but about understanding clinician behavior/cognition around alerts
- Patricia Flatley Brennan won the prestigious Morris F. Collen award. She spoke about the importance of thinking about the white spaces, the gap between visits.

## S08: Oral Presentations - Disease Identification, Management, and Mortality Prediction
- There's been a respectable collection of works on phenotype discovery (Joyce Ho, Yuan Luo, Jimeng Sun, etc.) via NMF. It's a blindspot I should investigate. Potential project idea: comparison of automatic phenotyping methods. I also think the idea of marrying supervised and unsupervised (semi-supervised) is crucial.

## Gala
- One of the fanciest events I've ever been to. See pics below.


## Missed Interesting Sessions
- Improving Sepsis Treatment Strategies by Combining Deep and Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning, used LSTM autoencoder
- i2b2 tutorial
- biomedical/healthcare blockchain
- Bayesian thinking
- marketplace for healthcare apps
