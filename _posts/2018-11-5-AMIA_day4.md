## FHIR app showcase
- bump of interest in fhir after apple revealed that the argonaut implementation guide was used for the apple health app
- Question: EHR > FHIR > webapp > EHR, what forms does that last step take, what are possible/available?
- apps
  - Nomogram, newborn weight tool (NEWT) by UCSF -- sidebar webapp
  - SMART on FHIR Shared Decision Making System for Diabetes Pharmacotherapy, Shinji Tarumi; Hitachi America, Ltd.

  - NLP2FHIR: A FHIR-based Clinical Data Normalization Pipeline and Its Application on Electronic Health Records (EHR)-Driven Phenotyping, Na Hong; Mayo Clinic (incl yuan luo) -- Question: what is the real-world application for computatioal phenotyping? is it recruitment for clin trials? nlp tools: ctakes, medxn, medtime. compared performance with or without ontology/terminology-mapped features (rxnorm/atc, snomed-ct, etc.)
  - Meducation® - A SMART on FHIR Integrated Solution Enabling Improved Patient Understanding of Medication Instructions and Regimens, Daniel Fritsch; First Databank, Inc. -- drug inserts @ college soph level in tiny font in eng. used HSPC sandbox. inserted into AVS.

  - DeepAISE on FHIR — An Interoperable Real-Time Predictive Analytic Platform for Early Prediction of Sepsis, Ashish Sharma; Emory University -- google cloud, mongodb, kubernetes, 5-min chunk updates, feature importance exposed to end-users, stock-exchange-like dashboard, based on [algo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286945)
  - CentricityTM Healthcare's FHIR application enables ‘Blue Button’ integration between Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Fenway Health, Kedar Ganta; VVC Holding Corp. (formerly GE Healthcare VBC) -- patient chart sharing across EHR systems.

## collaborative science within academic medicine (j.starren & p.payne presented)
  
## random thoughts
- the clinical prediction algorithm field is pretty saturated. instead of building a single fixed model, we should be providing model architectures and training guides so orgs can adapt it to their own patient populations. this could be the separating factor.

## poster
- met a guy from tu/e who works under the process mining guy, had a fun chat.
- met a few folks doing prediction - mostly uninteresting and underspecified
- local rxnav/api host via docker - see pic below

## etc
- election dinner, cello lopetegui, omkar lele, randi foraker, cynthia, andrea

## Misc.
* rxnav & rxnorm api docker
