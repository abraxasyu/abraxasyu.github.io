## S105: Oral Presentation - Clinical Prediction and Documentation
- flowsheet documentation study - payne mentioned in reference to time motion studies.
- data-driven order set review - order frequency, commonly discontinued, commonly added - great presenter.
- assessing epic sepsis model @ regional health system (univ of colorado at aurora). baseline: national early warning score (news). lactate order as time of sepsis. relatively shallow presentation. weird analysis - e.g. spectral analysis of sepsis admissions.

## S112: Panel - Computable Longitudinal Patient Trajectories
- Guergana Savova, extracting temporal relations from text, albert would like this
- Noemie Elhadad (from rimma's group) doing lda/topic modeling for phenotyping
- david gotz, evolution of outflow
- josh denny spoke who was at i2 symposium

## etc
- fix med-to-class script, assess completeness, etc., then see which class system is best for, e.g. mortality prediction.
- weighting std by feature importance post standardization (mean sub, std div) for distance-finding & clustering. Sort of similar to the idea of inverse document frequency, but more in the spirit of transfer learning. Motivation is that e.g. aspirin and morphine should not have same weights for distance-finding.
- try sigmoid imputation strategy
- look up phewas organization of icd codes

## end keynote
- involving patient in patient care
